* Future of Retail: Collapsible Force Directed Graph
  The following is a proposal of work for constructing a collapsible
  force-directed graph illustrating relationships between future
  retail concepts.

  At the estimated effort level and rate detailed below the total
  cost to Westfield will be *$1100*.

** Work
   The task is to use a force-directed graph with collapsible interior
   nodes to establish relationships between future retail concepts
   while enabling exploration within the confines of a browser window.

   The following work will be undertaken:

   - ~10hrs, force-directed graph construction
   - ~10hrs, testing and debugging
   - ~2hrs, deployment

   For a total of approximately 22 hours of work.

** Tools
   The primary tools will be web technologies for broad reach,
   accessibility and rapid prototyping:

   - HTML
   - JavaScript
   - CSS
   - [[d3.js][http://d3js.org/]]

     d3 is a rapidly becoming the industry standard for data
     [[https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery][visualization]] on the web. It mixes a simple API with standard
     templates to make quick work of data visualizations.

** Artifacts
   The output of the proposed work will be a hosted website viewable
   in modern browsers. This includes the following:

   - single page force directed graph constructed with d3.js
   - publicly hosted website, handoff to Westfield
   - git repository tracking the history of source code changes

   Modern browsers to be tested:

   - Desktop Chrome, Latest
   - Desktop Firefox, Latest
   - Desktop Internet Explorer, 10
   - Desktop Safari, Latest
   - Mobile Safari, Latest
   - Chrome for Android, Latest

** Rates/Cost

   My normal rate for front-end consulting is $200/hr. Since this
   would be my first project for Westfield and due to my relationship
   with the project participants I will discount my rate to $50/hr.
