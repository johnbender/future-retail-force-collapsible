Roughly 30% of retailers offer “buy online, pick up in store today” service. Another 34% plan to implement the capability within two years, and 18% say it will take more than two years, but plans are in the works."

Another patent Amazon holds is for a method of on-demand 3D manufacturing that allows products to be created on the way to customers’ homes. The only thing missing are driverless delivery vehicles and drones—also in rapid development. If consumers can quickly receive near-identical products from any retailer, anywhere in the world, it will drive an even greater imperative for retailers to differentiate themselves."
