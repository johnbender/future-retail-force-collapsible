Along with this exponential growth, we’ve seen social media evolve from a fad to a paradigm shift in the way the world communicates, one that’s helped spark everything from fashion trends to political revolutions.",

Predictive analytics will be able to harness data troves to tailor powerful experiences to individual interests, and help us cut through massive amounts of incoming content to hone in on the few pieces we actually want to see. The likely result: hyperpersonalized social media streams that give billions of us the content we want, when we want, from the people and brands we want. For brands, such changes can be a double-edged sword, one that requires them to create genuinely interesting and useful messages—and allows them to precisely target exact consumer niches."
