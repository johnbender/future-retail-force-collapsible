Today, robots are writing fantasy football recaps, internal sales reports for Fortune 500 companies, real estate listings, and other types of relatively simple reporting. They can even employ perspective, tone, and humor to tailor stories to their audience. In the future, robot journalists could act as “personal data scientists,” sifting through reams of data that might otherwise go unanalyzed to create custom reports for micro-audiences—for example, daily stories on your fitness tracking data and personal finances."              ],

In one, driverless cars will become part of the shared economy, moving from user to user once their task is complete. In the second scenario, people will be able to simultaneously deploy multiple autonomous vehicles, each completing its task without an occupant. In both cases, the changes to the automotive landscape will be enormous, with major impacts on other industries."

Without the need for a shopper to park each car, garages could become more flexible in their placement and more efficient in their layout.",

If the act of driving is no longer required, this becomes time where the occupant can multitask, shop, interact with brands, plan a visit, or be entertained. This time represents a significant opportunity for Westfield to interact with its customers long before and after they are physically at a center.",
                "One expected effect of driverless vehicles is cost reduction. Fewer or no accidents could reduce or eliminate need for auto insurance. Optimized energy usage could reduce cost and environmental effects. Ownership might not be required. All of these factors could lead to increased discretionary spending.",

High-speed trains allow people to work in urban centers but live far outside of them.
