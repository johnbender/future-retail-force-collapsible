As artificial intelligence (AI) improves, it can be used to not only locate, but also create, the right content for the right users. Fast and easy content creation in many sectors will in turn increase churn and reduce shelf life. And as consumers come to expect new forms of content (and content delivery) personalized to their needs and lifestyles, mobile content consumption will become more dominant. Bombarded by such rapidly changing content, consumers will look for information that is relevant, but also engaging and meaningful."

Such advances have companies such as Alibaba projecting three-day delivery anywhere in the world in as few as five to eight years. By then, Amazon will most likely have whittled delivery times to near zero for “local” deliveries. There will be new markets to access, new competition to fend off, new service expectations for physical retailers, and quick delivery from online retailers."

Class, as a set of ideas and beliefs or a perception of oneself, is in a process of rapid refinement and is unlikely to conform to the definitions of the past. For example, there are today classes of people defined by their employer (\“Googlers\”) or their social media presence (\“Instagram Influencers\”). New and fragmented definitions of class will make it more difficult for retailers to target, say, \“the Middle \Class”; they must instead interact with potential consumers in an increasingly personalized and niche way."

                  "Homeownership, traditionally a vehicle for wealth accumulation, is at a 20-year low in America. Battered by a struggling economy, huge student loan debt, and a weak job market, many people are forced to spend an outsized portion of their incomes on housing, leaving less for other necessities and discretionary spending. Trends such as the tiny home movement have gained in popularity with pressed young people as well as with those seeking to downsize in retirement. With financial freedom becoming more and more difficult to achieve, many people are beginning to rethink their relationship with material possessions, which could have a negative impact on the retail environment."

Wages have remained flat since 2000, partly due to outsourcing of jobs to countries where labor and manufacturing is cheaper.",

Instead, value has become more important to consumers.

Rattled by the Great Recession and often cast in a villainous light in discussions on wealth and class, highly affluent consumers in the US may also be cautious about visible displays of luxury products, instead splurging on services, time savers, and experiences. But US cultural norms do not apply everywhere; wealthy foreign tourists are highly likely to remain a strong source of sales."
