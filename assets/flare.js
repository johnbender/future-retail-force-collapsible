The virtual world will continue to supplement the physical world via phones and connected wearable devices. Shoppers may also access information and special offers through augmented reality—for example, seeing how they would look in clothing without trying it on. Opt-in choices will give consumers access to tools and experiences; for example, bathing suit shoppers might get recommendations based on body shape and size, virtually try on their choices, and then pick them up from a sales associate at the counter."

One of the most frustrating parts of in-store shopping is waiting to check out. Many retailers are likely to follow Apple’s lead with mobile self-checkout. The customer finds what he or she needs, scans it, selects a payment method, and finalizes the transaction, without waiting—or possibly talking to an associate. As consumers become increasingly comfortable with contactless payments, the ability to control when and where checkout happens will become more prevalent."
